# Street Smart Widget for ArcGIS Online

A simple Cyclorama Widget based on our Street Smart API.
See: https://www.cyclomedia.com/ for more information.

## Getting Started

To create a fresh clone from the (new) git repository, use the following command (or just use the url from a git GUI application like TortoiseGit):
 ```
 git clone ssh://credentials@vm-3d-srv01:/srv/viewing/git/streetsmartwidget4aol.git
 ```

Modify the url above so it contains your user name instead of credentials. i.e. "gbo".

Also, if not already done, please configure git so it knows you (Firstname Lastname AND full email!):
```
git config -global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
git config -global user.email "your_official_email@cyclomedia.com"
```

## Versioning

We use YEAR.MAJOR.PATCH versioning.
i.e.: 16.1.0 = year 2016, major version 1, patch 0 .

We also make use of:

Street Smart API:
	api.version: 16.1
	api.location: [Street Smart API](https://streetsmart.cyclomedia.com/api/v16.1/StreetSmartAPI.js)

Aperture API:
	api.location: [Aperture API](https://streetsmart.cyclomedia.com/api/v16.1/Aperture.js)
